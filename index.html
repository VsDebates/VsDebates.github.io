<h1>Vs Debates</h1>

<p style="color:white;" >This is my site for posting analysis of vs battles - be it match-ups other enthusiasts have proposed or a raw product of my own imagination. For each match up I will attempt to accurately conclude a winner without any pre-bias, arriving at my answer  solely through logic and rationality. Every battle will contain a list of driect links  to the Sources I used to reach my verdict. I think that's about everything I need to mention, if you think my argument is flawed, have a suggestion or even just wish to get involved , thenn you can email regarding such inquiries at <a href="mailto:vs.debates.site@gmail.com">vs.debates.site@gmail.com</a>.</p>
